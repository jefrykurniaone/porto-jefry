## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- In-memory rate limiter is serverless-unsafe → Phase 3 replaces with Upstash Redis / Vercel KV
- `useMessages()` + double cast for Experience bullets is a known workaround → Phase 4 eliminates it
- Manual `LAST_MODIFIED_DATE` constant requires manual updates → Phase 4 automates via git at build time

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SEC-03 (distributed rate limiting) requires Upstash Redis or Vercel KV env vars to be provisioned before Phase 3 executes
